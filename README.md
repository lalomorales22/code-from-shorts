# 👋 hey! you found my code

so you just watched one of my videos and thought "wait, i want to try that" - that's exactly what i was hoping for!

## 🔍 finding your file

each video has the filename in the description. just search this repo for it or browse the folders:


## 🚀 running the code

most files are pretty straightforward:

**python files:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt  # if there's one
python filename.py
```

**web apps:**
```bash
pip install flask anthropic  # or whatever's needed
python app.py
# then open localhost:5000
```

**html files:**
just open them in your browser

## 💡 make it yours

here's the thing - these aren't just "copy and paste" files. they're starting points. 

**try this:**
- change the colors
- add new features  
- break it (seriously, breaking code teaches you more than tutorials)
- fix what you broke
- make it solve YOUR problem

## 🤝 if you build something cool

i'd love to see what you make! tag me or drop a comment on the video. seeing people actually use this stuff is what makes me want to keep building.

## ⚠️ heads up

- some files need API keys (anthropic, openai, etc.) - i put placeholder text where you need to add yours
- if something breaks, check the comments in the code first
- most "bugs" are missing dependencies - just pip install whatever's complaining
- sqlite databases create themselves when you run the file

## 🧠 why single files?

because when you're learning, seeing everything in one place makes way more sense than hunting through 50 different files trying to understand how they connect.

plus, there's something satisfying about a single file that does something amazing. it feels more... achievable? like "i could actually build this myself."

## 🎯 what's next?

if you liked the video and want to see more:
- subscribe for daily code projects
- suggest what you want to see built next
- share your own single-file creations

remember: every senior developer started with their first "hello world." the difference between a beginner and an expert isn't talent - it's just building more stuff.
